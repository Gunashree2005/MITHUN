  <p>Škoda Auto a.s., often shortened to Škoda, is a Czech automobile manufacturer established in 1925 as the successor to Laurin & Klement and headquartered in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic. Škoda Works became state owned in 1948. After 1991, it was gradually privatized to the German Volkswagen Group, becoming a partial subsidiary in 1994 and a wholly owned subsidiary in 2000.[3][4]

Škoda automobiles are sold in over 100 countries and in 2018, total global sales reached 1.25 million units, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year.[5] The operating profit was €1.6 billion in 2017, an increase of 34.6% over the previous year.[6][7] As of 2017, Škoda's profit margin was the second highest of all Volkswagen AG brands after Porsche.
